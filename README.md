### Intro

Kidspeak is a `track` or a mini conference which I created especially designed for young ones. It allows parents to bring their young ones to a conference and enjoy the glorious sessions while their young ones are learning and in the breaks they can check up on the progress of their children.

The event is suitable for ages 7 to 17 with no previous experience with programming needed.

Kidspeak encourages people to get into technology at an early age. In order for each attendee to get proper care and mentoring we recommend only running the event with a smaller group.

It was a blast, and we look forward to seeing you at future events!

### Usage
