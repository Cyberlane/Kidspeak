### Intro

Kidspeak is a `track` or a mini conference which was originally held inside Leetspeak 2016, especially designed for children. It allows parents to bring their child to Leetspeak and enjoy the glorious sessions while their child is learning and in the breaks they can check up on the progress of their children. This year we aim for children between 7 and 17 with no previous experience with programming needed.

Kidspeak encourages children to get into technology at an early age. In order for each child to get proper care and mentoring we are only running a very small group of children - places are very limited.

Kidspeak was in the same venue as Leetspeak just a floor down from the main conference.

It was a blast, and we look forward to seeing you at future events!

### Websites

There are two official websites for Kidspeak, but don't worry, this is good thing!

https://kidspeak.se/ is the events website, owned and managed by [tretton37](https://tretton37.com). This will only be updated when there are events being organised.

https://kidspeak.code-blocks.com is the code and documentation website, owned and managed by [Justin Nel](https://cyber-lane.com). I will continue to keep this one up to date as new code is made, or anything about the platform itself changes.

### Code

Code is based off of the Google Blockly library, but has been modified extensively for specific purpose of the Kidspeak event.
