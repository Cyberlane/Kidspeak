# KIDSPEAK 2016, 15TH OCTOBER - MALMÃ–

![Kidspeak logo](https://leetspeak.se/2016/images/kidspeak/logo.png)

Kidspeak is a `track` or a mini conference inside Leetspeak especially designed for children. It allows parents to bring their child to Leetspeak and enjoy the glorious sessions while their child is learning and in the breaks they can check up on the progress of their children. This year we aim for children between 7 and 17 with no previous experience with programming needed.

Kidspeak encourages children to get into technology at an early age. In order for each child to get proper care and mentoring we are only running a very small group of children - places are very limited.

Kidspeak is in the same venue as Leetspeak just a floor down from the main conference. Registration starts at 8:00 and the workshop starts at 9:00.

It is going to be a blast, and we look forward to seeing you there!

### Code

Code is based off of the Google Blockly library, but has been modified extensively for specific purpose of Kidspeak.
